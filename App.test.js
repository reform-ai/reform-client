// Test version: Video upload instead of live streaming
// 1. Get user input on exercise type (squat, lift their leg/PT exercise, etc.), without needing to know. 
// 2. Front end allows user to upload a video file.
// 3. Video is sent to the Reform backend, along with the user input on exercise type.
// 4. <Wait for this> Backend processes the video frames and outputs, to start, text feedback. TODO Add audio feedback.
// 5. Text feedback is sent to the frontend and displayed to the user. TODO Add audio feedback.
