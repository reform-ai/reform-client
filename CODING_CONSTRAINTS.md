# Coding Constraints

These constraints are established to ensure best practices in debugging and maintainability.

## Technology Stack

1. **Main Components**: JavaScript and React
2. **Machine Learning**: Python (for ML-specific components)

## Function Constraints

1. **Function Length**: Each function should be written under **20 lines**
2. **External Libraries**: No external libraries unless explicitly instructed otherwise
3. **File Organization**: Functions should be split up into different files whenever possible

## Rationale

These constraints promote:
- **Debuggability**: Shorter functions are easier to debug and test
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to navigate and modify
- **Dependency Management**: Minimizing external libraries reduces complexity and potential conflicts
- **Code Clarity**: Breaking functions into separate files improves code organization and readability

*These constraints apply to all code written for the Reform v0 launch.*
