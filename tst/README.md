# Test Directory

This directory contains all test code, organized to mirror the `src/` structure.

## Structure

Tests are organized in `__tests__/` directories that mirror the source code structure:
- `tst/backend/` - Tests for backend components
- `tst/frontend/` - Tests for frontend components

Each component in `src/` has a corresponding test directory in `tst/` with the same path structure.

See `TEST_STRUCTURE.md` for detailed test organization documentation.
